## Problem Statement
###### Given a string S, count the number of non-empty sub strings that are palindromes.
###### A sub string is any continuous sequence of characters in the string. 
###### A string is said to be palindrome, if the reverse of the string is same as itself.
###### Two sub strings are different if they occur at different positions in S. 
###### Solve using Dynamic programming.
