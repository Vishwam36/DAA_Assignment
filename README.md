## Problem Statement
###### Given a string S, count the number of non-empty sub strings that are palindromes. A sub string is any continuous sequence of characters in the string. A string is said to be palindrome, if the reverse of the string is same as itself. Two sub strings are different if they occur at different positions in S. Solve using Dynamic programming.
